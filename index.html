            Lori lived her life through the lens of a camera.
             She never realized this until this very moment as she scrolled through thousands of 
             images on your computer. She could remember the exact moment each photo was taken. She could remember where she 
             had been, <br> what she was thinking as she tried to get the shot, the smells of the surrounding area, and even the
              emotions that she felt taking the photo, yet she had trouble remembering what she had for breakfast.
